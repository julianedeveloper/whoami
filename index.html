    </h3>

    <h3>
        To writer for me it's a weapon. Using the power of the words (the corrects ones) and the magic of css, I must confess that I am a falling in love to frontend for a longtime. But now, I am learning admire all the magic that has behind the scenes, as to server side, known as backend.
    </h3>

    <h3>
        One feature in me that I'm proud of keep it's be strong and discipline.
        I do what I must to do. Period. And I am strong to accept that I'll fail. For sure. That's what makes me human. But you can bet that I won't denied the error or make the same mistake again. 
    </h3>
